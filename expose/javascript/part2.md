## Q17
Output: [ 2, 4, 6 ]
When modifyArray is called, it takes in 2 parameters, an array, 'array' and a function 'callback'. In this case, the 'array' is [1,2,3] and 'callback' is 'doSomething'. doSomething takes in an integer and returns the the integer multiplied by 2. 'modifyArray' on the other hand calls 'callback' on every element in 'array' and returns a new array with the new values. Since 'callback' is 'doSomething' which multiplies by 2, every value in array is multiplied by 2 and is returned.
